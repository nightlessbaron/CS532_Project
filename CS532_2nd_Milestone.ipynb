It is a magazine for those who love antiques and also those who consider themselves historians since many articles deal with historical collections of art and antiques.\\n\\nThis magazine is overflowing with antique goods and information. The articles contained in this magazine are intended to be visually stimulating in some cases, educational in others. They offer history lessons on the art that was popular during a specific era, a glimpse into an art collection at a museum, and more. The articles are meant to stimulate the interests of those who already like this subject and they often provide a means to learn more, to discover places to see or purchase some of the featured works, and to develop an appreciation for the craftsmanship that went into making these items.\\n\\nAntiques Magazine is a publication dedicated to creative art and history but one thing that isn't very creative is the titles of the articles. This might surprise some readers at first, but the editors at Antiques decided to get straight to the point in the naming of the featured articles rather than try to be creative. The features thus have titles like \\\"The Eating Utensil Collection\\\", \\\"Spanish Culture in Art\\\", etc. Each title points out exactly what the article covers, leaving nothing to the imagination.\\n\\nThe writing in Antiques is certainly good and well- edited. But I'm afraid that many readers will find the articles a little boring. They describe things well and they usually offer a good history lesson. But they lack spark and readability. I have tried to read some articles in this magazine and found my eyelids getting heavy and my thoughts drifting to other subjects. This is why I generally stick with the pictures when I glance at Antiques Magazine. I don't bother reading because most of the material doesn't keep my interest.\\n\\nOverall, Antiques Magazine is an okay publication and unless you have a deep interest in antiques and their history, you will likely become bored quickly if you try to read the articles. But the pictures in Antiques are often very interesting. Even if you have little interest in reading a magazine like this one, the photos alone make it worth an occasional look.\", \"summary\": \"Antiques Magazine is Good, but not for Everyone\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1174694400}\n",

Period.\\n\\nAs an MPC reader you naturally become the PC nerd amongst your friends, family, and coworkers, that everybody keeps coming to for advise and requests for help.\\n\\nFor instance at the launch of new operating system, such as with windows 8, and win 7, you'll get mobbed by confused hordes of PC users with a lost sense of direction.\\n\\nYou become their sole bastion of hope standing solidly there in the middle, that they can hold on to for guidance.\\n\\nThere are also little tid bits of information that can unexpectedly result in huge payoffs. In a little corner in one issue for example, they showed how to insert a check mark in my Utorrent software, that encrypted its outgoing traffic, so that my ISP couldn't invade my privacy anymore, and so had to stop bothering and threatening me about my sharing of copyrighted materials with my friends. That was a relief!\\n\\nI also like the fact that the magazine deals with both computer hardware, and software - though the emphasis is on hardware.\\n\\nThere are also letters to the computer doctor who diagnoses and then gives good advice on a range of computer illnesses and hiccups.\\n\\nYou also get the latest news taking place in the tech world and on copyright issues.\\n\\nOverall It is a well rounded publication with a little for everyone, young and old, great and small.\\n\\nI have the kindle for Ipad version, and it is the absolute best.
